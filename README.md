## General Information

The files found in this repo are only useful when provided with some "context", i.e. learning the theory behind these files is important. The theory will be presented by the instructor, with information / documentation provided in the docs repository [here](https://github.com/university-of-toronto-fsf/rnspotify-docs.git).

## Updates

* The minimal first four steps have been posted in this repository for review. You do not have to do these steps prior to the workshop, but they are here to provide context to how the workshop will run

## Workflow

1. Each branch represents a particular "step" in the development workflow of the exercise.
2. The starting files of a particular branch represent the "solution" of the previous branch. For example, branch "02" represents the solution for branch "01". So you can use the different branches as a guide to see what your end goal should be.
3. Additionally, when working with the exercises, the code found within each file contains instructions in comment form that indicate how you should proceed completing writing the code for that particular file. The steps are in line with the theory that are being presented by your instructor. Hence, this repository only becomes more beneficial with the theory provided by your instructor.
